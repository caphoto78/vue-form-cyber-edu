Can you please help us learn more about the situation?\n \nQ1. Some corrupted employees tried to dump admin passwords, using a popular script among hackers, but we don\u2019t know exactly its name. Can you help us in the investigation?\nFlag format: CTF{process_name}\n\nQ2. For us, it\u2019s very difficult to make the difference between a legit and a malicious command using Windows native tools. Can you please identify what command was used by the attacker when downloading the malware on our system?\nFlag format: command line used by the attacker\n\nQ3. We also know that the attackers used multiple attacking persistent threats & scripts when attacked our systems. Can you please help us determine what is the name of the initial script used for performing the attack?\nFlag format: CTF{script_name)\n\nQ4. Victims to these attacks reported that a new admin account was created on their operating machines. What is the command used by the attacker to activate the new account?\nFlag format: command line\n\n**Pre-requisited: **\n\n1. Docker & docker-compose installed\n2. Run ELK: docker-compose up --build\n3. Connect to Kibana using default port.\n\nPS:\n\n- If your chall is broken then try ```sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144```\n\nThe challenge was proposed by [BIT SENTINEL](https:\/\/bit-sentinel.com\/).","difficulty":"Medium","difficulty_score":2,"points":"400","type":"standalone","section":null,"status":"enabled","is_subscribed":false,"is_owned":false,"author":{"id":"53b0ccb0-7f21-11ea-9207-e5b2776fa6ac","name":"Volf","name_acronym":"V","country":"Romania","roles":["challenges_author","player"],"type":"user","trashed":false,"created_at":{"date":"2020-02-24 16:05:25","timestamp":1582560325,"for_humans":"11 months ago"}},"tags":[{"id":2,"name":"Network","type":"default"},{"id":7,"name":"Forensics","type":"default"},{"id":35,"name":"D-CTF 2020 Online","type":"collection"},{"id":1276,"name":"T1204: User Execution","type":"mittre"},{"id":1278,"name":"T098: Account Manipulation","type":"mittre"},{"id":1346,"name":"T1040: Network Sniffing","type":"mittre"},{"id":1347,"name":"T1003: OS Credential Dumping","type":"mittre"},{"id":1398,"name":"T1105: Ingress Tool Transfer","type":"mittre"}],"counts":{"attempts":30,"owned":8},"attempts":[],"podium_attempts":[],"created_at":{"date":"2020-12-04 14:38:49","timestamp":1607092729,"for_humans":"2 months ago"},"updated_at":{"date":"2020-12-09 10:48:55","timestamp":1607510935,"for_humans":"1 month ago"}},{"id":"f57d78e0-3639-11eb-993e-e927c3757fd3","title":"why-xor","description":"Let's be fair, we all start with XOR, and we keep enjoying it.\n\nFlag format: CTF{sha256}\n\nThe challenge was proposed by [BIT SENTINEL](https:\/\/bit-sentinel.com\/).","difficulty":"Entry Level","difficulty_score":0,"points":"10","type":"standalone","section":null,"status":"enabled","is_subscribed":false,"is_owned":false,"author":{"id":"53a4cc10-7f21-11ea-a5f5-ddf2f6ba3dfe","name":"Lucian Ioan Nitescu","name_acronym":"LI","country":"Romania","roles":["challenges_author"],"type":"user","trashed":false,"created_at":{"date":"2020-02-17 08:55:45","timestamp":1581929745,"for_humans":"11 months ago"}},"tags":[{"id":12,"name":"Cryptography","type":"default"},{"id":35,"name":"D-CTF 2020 Online","type":"collection"},{"id":998,"name":"Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort -

The authentication is unilateral, and works as follows:\n\n1.\tAlice requests access to the server by sending her username.\n2.\tThe server randomly selects 2 values index1 and index2 (1 <= index1 < index2 <= 64), and challenges Alice with (index1, index2).\n3.\tAlice applies SHA256 to her password, keeps the hex characters placed on the positions index1 and index2 unchanged and changes all the other hex characters to a different value. Then, she sends the result to the server.\n4.\tThe server receives the response, and checks if the received string equals the SHA256 value stored in the database for Alice\u2019s username in exactly two positions: index1 and index2. \n5.\tTo decrease the chances to obtain access by luck, the server repeats the procedure and sends several requests to Alice before allowing her to access the e-mail. If Alice replies correctly to all challenges, then she is successfully authenticated; if not, Alice is denied access.\n\nFor example:\n\n- username: Alice\n- password: ageneralpassword\n- SHA256(password) = aad3```e```da32ce777fa1cb3ca97ac7e1bfdd726053e05e0109b3526a63fed4```5```19b7\n- index1 = 5 and index2 = 60\n- Valid reply (only hex characters on positions 5 and 60 are unchanged):\n4c77```e```f3010c2f5c274ebbb0ff5abe001eeb5ce0f944dd1402caaf9ddx47```5```bffe \n- Invalid reply (hex characters on positions 9 and 57 are also the same):\n4c77```e```f30```2```0c2f5c274ebbb0ff5abe001eeb5ce0f944dd1402caaf9dd```e```47```5```bffe \n- Invalid reply (hex character on position 5 is different):\n4c77```f```f3010c2f5c274ebbb0ff5abe001eeb5ce0f944dd1402caaf9ddx47```5```bffe\n\nAn adversary masquerades the server, and fools Alice to reply to his challenges. You are not given access to the challenges, but you know that the adversary only queried positions from the first half of the hash. You also have all the replies from Alice in Alice_replies.txt, and you know that the adversary found the complete hash.
